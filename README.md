##Introduction to Machine learning
#Description
“Machine learning systems are made up of three major parts, which are:
#•	Model: the system that makes predictions or identifications.
#•	Parameters: the signals or factors used by the model to form its decisions.
#•	Learner: the system that adjusts the parameters — and in turn the model — by looking at differences in predictions versus actual outcome.”
#- Greg Corrado, a senior research scientist with Google and cofounder of the company’s deep learning team.
Machine learning in short, is teaching computers to find patterns that might not be easily spotted by human eyed. This course is going to give you wide range of tools to analysis your data, applying design thinking process on data iterations and understanding what algorithms to apply. 
Target Audience / Experience
#•	This course is for developers or data engineers looking to apply machine learning on analysis
#•	Viewers should have a basic understanding of algebra, statistics, and calculus. Some familiarity with the Python will also be helpful but is not required.
Learning Objectives
#•	Defining the problems and data relevance 
#•	Understand how and which algorithms to apply 
#•	Confortable with different ML tools such as sklearn, python, ipython, numpy, matplotlib
